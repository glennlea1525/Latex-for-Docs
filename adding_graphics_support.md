The pack­age builds upon the graph­ics pack­age, pro­vid­ing a key-value in­ter­face for op­tional ar­gu­ments to the \in­clude­graph­ics com­mand. This in­ter­face pro­vides fa­cil­i­ties that go far be­yond what the graph­ics pack­age of­fers on its own. Do not use the older graphics package when using graphicx
