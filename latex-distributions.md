You need to install a TeX distribution and select a LaTeX editor. You can download all this software for free.

## Selecting a TeX Distribution

Before you can begin working with LaTeX, you need to first install a TeX distribution. This is a typesetting program that takes the LaTeX files and generates output based on the settings in the LaTeX files.

TeX distributions are available for Linux, Windows and MAC.

For Windows, you can use *proTeXt* which you can download at <a href="http://www.tug.org/protext/">www.tug.org/protext/</a>.

For MAC OS, you can use *MacTeX*, which can be downloaded at <a href="http://www.tug.org/mactex/">www.tug.org/mactex/</a>.

Instructions for installing these programs are provided on the sites where they are available.

## Selecting a LaTeX Editor

Using a simple text editor has its advantages. I can create LaTeX files in an editor such as NotePad++, Atom or even Eclipse and then compile the LaTeX file on the Command Line.

Plenty of LaTeX editors are available.

For Windows, you can use TeXworks which can be downloaded at <a href="https://www.tug.org/texworks/">www.tug.org/texworks/</a>. For MAC, a good tool is TeXnicCenter which can be downloaded at <a href="http://www.texniccenter.org/">http://www.texniccenter.org/</a>.

So, you can choose how you best want to work. For me, an editor that adds tags, closes tags correctly and has a menu selection for generating output works fine.
