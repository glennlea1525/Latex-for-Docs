Before we start actually working with the output from the converted PDF file as described in the previoius topic, lets look at how to generate an output file from a LaTeX file.

**To build a LaTeX file**

1. Type the following in a LaTeX editor and save the file as `HelloWorld.tex` in a convenient location on your PC or MAC.

        \documentclass{article}
        \begin{document}
        \title{Title of Document}
        \author{Your Name}
        \date{\today}
        \maketitle
        \tableofcontents
        \section{Section Head}
        Hello, world!
        \section{Second Section Head}
        This is the last thing I am going to say here!
        \end{document}

2. Build the LaTeX file. You can do this on the command line or in a LaTeX editor such as TeXworks. In TeXworks, for example, select the build option *pdfLaTeX+MakeIndex+BibTex* from the *Build* menu, then click *Build* (the arrow next to the dropdown menu). Alternately, open a terminal (MAC) or Command Prompt (Windows) and change to the directory where you saved the file. Then run the following command **twice** to build the file and to generate a table of contents:

        pdflatex HelloWorld.tex
        pdflatex HelloWorld.tex

3. In the directory containing `HelloWorld.tex` you will find a whole bunch of new files in there. For now, find the file `HelloWorld.pdf`and open it in a pdf viewer.
