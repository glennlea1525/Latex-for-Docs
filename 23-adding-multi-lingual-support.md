You can set the language for the document. The babel pack­age man­ages cul­tur­ally-de­ter­mined ty­po­graph­i­cal (and other) rules, and hy­phen­ation pat­terns for a wide range of lan­guages. A doc­u­ment may se­lect a sin­gle lan­guage to be sup­ported, or it may se­lect sev­eral, in which case the doc­u­ment may switch from one lan­guage to an­other in a va­ri­ety of ways. Ba­bel uses con­tributed con­fig­u­ra­tion files that pro­vide the de­tail of what has to be done for each lan­guage.

In this case, we use US English.
